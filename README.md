Data Structures Repository

Welcome to the Data Structures repository, where we explore and implement various fundamental data structures in Python. This repository serves as a resource for students, educators, and anyone interested in understanding the inner workings and applications of different data structures.
Overview

This repository contains implementations of several data structures, each with its own unique applications and characteristics. The goal is to provide a hands-on approach to learning and understanding these critical components of computer science.
Contents

    __init__.py: An initialization file to make Python treat the directories as containing packages.
    arsenal_team.py: A custom implementation related to an Arsenal team structure. Used for personal testing
    linked_hash.py: An implementation of a linked hash structure, combining aspects of linked lists and hash tables.
    linked_list.py: A classic implementation of linked lists, showcasing methods for insertion, deletion, and traversal.
    linked_stack.py: An implementation of a stack data structure using a linked list approach.
    test_LinkedList: A test suite designed to verify the functionality and integrity of the linked list implementation.

Getting Started

To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine using the following command:

bash

git clone https://github.com/AlexJarvis1210/Data-Structures.git

Navigate into the repository directory:

bash

cd Data-Structures

You can run the Python scripts individually to see the data structures in action. For example:

bash

python linked_list.py
